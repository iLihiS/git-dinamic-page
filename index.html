                        This work focuses on human-agent co-creation of improvised stories, investigating whether Large Language Models can effectively engage in an improvisational practice known as the "Yes! and…" game. We demonstrate how AI systems can participate successfully in improvisational co-creation, moving beyond response generation to collaborative story-telling. We provide a systematic framework for evaluating creative AI outputs in improvisational contexts, combining human evaluation with computational metrics. Our evaluations show that stories co-created with an AI agent are indistinguishable from stories co-created with a human in terms of novelty, value, and surprise. This shows how "hallucinations" – typically considered problematic in AI systems – can serve as creative assets in collaborative storytelling. More generally, our approach presents the "Yes! and…" game as a novel model-system for studying improvised co-creativity in a well-defined and measurable setup.

                        <p>Our research investigates Large Language Models' ability to engage in the "Yes! and..." improvisational game, 
                        a collaborative storytelling practice where participants build upon each other's contributions. We developed 
                        AI agents that can participate in this creative process, moving beyond traditional response generation to 
                        active co-creation.</p>

                        <p>We conducted systematic evaluations comparing AI-human co-created stories with human-human co-created stories. 
                        Our evaluation framework combines human assessment with computational metrics, measuring novelty, value, and

                        co-created with humans across all measured dimensions. This reveals how AI "hallucinations" – typically
